# Algorithmic Trading in Python

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end algorithmic trading system written in Python. It integrates trading strategies (like MACD, VWAP, and TEMA), API interactions with Robinhood or other brokers, and an efficient scheduler to execute trades in real-time. The system is designed to automate cryptocurrency trading, focusing on Bitcoin as an example.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)
- A Robinhood API account or other crypto API access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Algorithmic-Trading-in-Python.git
   cd Algorithmic-Trading-in-Python
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure API keys:
   - Add your API key and private key to a `.env` file or `config/api_config.py`.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📊 Features

- **Trading Strategies**: Implements technical indicators like MACD, VWAP, TEMA, and custom risk management techniques.
- **Automated Scheduling**: Uses `schedule` to run strategies at specified intervals.
- **API Integration**: Interacts with trading APIs to place and manage orders.
- **Logging**: Tracks trades, errors, and account value changes.
- **Risk Management**: Implements stop-loss, take-profit, and account value monitoring.

## 🚦 How to Use

1. **Define Trading Strategies**:
   Modify or add your strategies in `trading_strategy.py`.

2. **Set Intervals**:
   Schedule your strategies in `main.py` using `start_scheduler()`:
   ```python
   start_scheduler([BTC_trading_strategy], 10)  # Executes every 10 seconds
   ```

3. **Run the System**:
   Execute `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Monitor Logs**:
   Logs are stored in `trading_scheduler.log` for debugging and analysis.

## 🧠 Trading Strategies

### 1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
Calculates two EMAs (short-term and long-term) to identify buy/sell signals.

### 2. **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**
Uses volume and price data to measure market trends.

### 3. **TEMA (Triple Exponential Moving Average)**
Reduces lag in EMA calculations to provide accurate signals.

### 4. **MVCD (Modified Volatility Convergence Divergence)**
Leverages volatility-based analysis for trade decisions.
